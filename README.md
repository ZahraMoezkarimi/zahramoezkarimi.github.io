## Research Interests

<h3>Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS)</h3>
<b>Definition</b>: Cyber-physical systems (CPS) provide an excellent basis for digitizing advanced industrial systems and applications. CPSs integrate physical, computational and communication subsystems, typically including sensors, controllers and actuators. These systems are used in a wide range of applications including, but not limited to, automotive, avionics, robotics and smart grids.<br /> 

<b>My research interest</b> Digital Twins
<br /> 
<br /> 
<h3>Privacy Policies</h3>
<b>Definition</b>: The concept of privacy was initially introduced as ‘the right to be left alone’ and is recognized as a fundamental human right by many international norms and regulations. Privacy is further elaborated by Alan Westin as ‘the claim of individuals, groups, or institutions to determine for themselves when, how and to what extent information about them is communicated’; this is currently known as the informational self-determination right and used as a means to limit the abuse of personal data.

<b>My research interest</b>: Policy-aware systems; Secure-by-construction systems. <!-- , Automated reasoning  -->
<br /> 
<br /> 
<h3>Epistemic Logic</h3> 
<b>Definition</b>: A logic for reasoning about agents' knowledge and beliefs.<br />  

<b>My research interest</b>: Epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty.
